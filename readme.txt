Add the SimpleStage Web Request script to your website.

== Description ==
Collaborate directly from your website using our website feedback tools
SimpleStage gives you the tools to collect bugs and feedback directly on a website. With a quick setup on a staged or live website, clients have the capability to annotate, draw, and identify issues on their site. SimpleStage automatically captures the technical details to give you the information that you need to knock out tasks.

On-Site tools
Our on-site tools allow your clients to submit feedback and bug reports directly on their website.

Details you need to solve problems
SimpleStage automatically collects helpful details such as the user’s screen size and browser to help you solve problems faster.

Easy installation
Installing SimpleStage is as easy as placing a script on the staged or live website, and clients don’t need any technical skill to begin using the on-site tools.

Manage tasks in a board or list layout
Collected tasks are easy to manage and assign in both a kanban style board view and a list view.
